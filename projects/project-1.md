OnBase by Hyland is a web-based document imaging solution. The software captures documents and data, manages information in one system, and stores, protects, and destroys content securely.

My office, which is the College of Social Sciences undergraduate advising office, needed to find a solution to transition from paper-based to paperless student records. As the project lead for the advising team, I researched and initiatied conversations with ITS Entreprise Content Management (ECM) team. After the initial meeting, my office became the pilot group for a newly developed document imaging solution for university student records. 

In order for the solution to be developed, I met with my office users to gather a list of our needs and wants. Additionally, I asked that an advisor join the team to serve as the subject matter expert. As part of the discovery and requirements gathering, I inventoried all documents, determined the keywords to tag each document, determined user and group permissions, created a flowchart of the documents, created a user guide, and provided training to all users. 

The advising and ECM teams met weekly to discuss, design, and test the solution. My office implemented the document solution within a year. As other advising units heard about our solution, we provided demonstrations and guidance on how they can use the solution. Currently, Natural Sciences and SOEST advising units implemented OnBase for their student records.
