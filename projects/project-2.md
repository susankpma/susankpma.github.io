Professor Newton Presents: Simple Machines was an instructional design project my teammate and I worked on for ETEC 613. 

My teammate was a third grade teacher who needed an instructional design lesson on simple machines to be used in her science lesson. We both designed, planned, and developed the chapters that explained the physics concepts needed to understand a simple machine. We included fun tips on experiments the students can do at home to apply these concepts. To evaluate student understanding, we wrote the pre- and post- tests for the third graders. My teammate administered the tests and provided observations on each students' comprehension of the concepts.

This project taught me techniques to develop and design content for instruction. After completing this project, I gained an appreciation for teachers who dedicate their time, money, and energy to instill knowledge in students.
